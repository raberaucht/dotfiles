## dotfiles
My personal dotfiles. Managed by dotbot.

###Installation

```
> cd dotfiles

> ./install
```

Only vim and zsh-related dotfiles will be installed.


###Colors and Fonts

- Use iTerm2
- Nice color schemes in iTerm2 are Pastel (Dark Background) or [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)
- vim uses powerline, so install a [powerline compatible font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

###Using zsh on OSX
If you want to use zsh on OSX, open System Preferences/Users & Groups/Advanced Options and change your shell to zsh.
